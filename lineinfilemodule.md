Ansible lineinfile Module
lineinfile is one of the most versatile modules in Ansible. You can use it to add, modify, remove, or replace a line or multiple lines in the hostâ€™s configuration files. You can also use it to create file backups or change file permissions and ownership.

It offers several parameters to customize its behavior:

*path (required): Specifies the path to the file on the remote host where the modification needs to be made.
*line (required): Defines the line to be added, replaced, or removed in the file.
*state (optional): Determines the desired state of the line. Possible values are present (default), absent, before, or after.
*regexp (optional): Specifies a regular expression pattern to search for in the file. The module performs actions on lines matching this pattern.
*backrefs (optional): Enables the use of backreferences in regular expressions for replacement purposes.
*insertafter/insertbefore (optional): Specifies a line before or after which the line should be inserted when the state is set to present.
*insertafter_regex/insertbefore_regex (optional): Similar to insertafter/insertbefore, but using regular expressions to define the line.
*create (optional): Determines whether to create the file if it doesn't exist. Set to yes or no (default).
The idempotent property of Ansible modules allows them to be used repeatedly without resulting in undesired side effects. In the case of the lineinfile module, it ensures that changes are only made when absolutely necessary, based on the parameters supplied and the file's present state.
