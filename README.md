This is my first Ansible Project

Run below command to execute yaml file:

## Dry Run In Ansible
Ansible Dry Run or Ansible Check mode feature is to validate your playbook before execution. 
With the Ansible Dry Run feature, you can execute the playbook without having to actually make changes on the server. 
this enables us to see what changes are going to be made when the playbook is run.
